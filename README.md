# Choose your adventure in Python
A short program I created using python. Ensure python is installed on your computer.  
Meant to run on the command line. Download the code, and from the command line, use cd commands to move to the directory where the file is stored. 
From there, to run the code, type 'python ex36.py text' and hit enter. Enjoy! Please let me know about any errors or issues that arise.
